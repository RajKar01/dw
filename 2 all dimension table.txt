Dimension tables and fact tables are fundamental components in a data warehousing and business intelligence system. They serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics:

Dimension Table:

A dimension table contains descriptive information or attributes about business entities.
It is often used to provide context and details to facts in a fact table.
Typically, dimension tables are smaller in size compared to fact tables.
Examples of dimension tables include customer, product, time, location, and employee dimensions.
Dimension tables are usually used for filtering, grouping, and aggregating data in a data warehouse.
Fact Table:

A fact table contains quantitative or numeric performance measures (facts) that are typically additive and can be aggregated.
It stores metrics, measures, and performance indicators related to business events or transactions.
Fact tables often have foreign keys that link to dimension tables to provide additional context.
Fact tables are typically larger and store historical data.
Examples of fact tables include sales, revenue, order, and inventory fact tables.
Fact tables are used for analytical queries, reporting, and data analysis.
In a typical data warehousing system, dimension tables are used to provide descriptive information about the entities involved in business transactions, while fact tables store the quantitative data generated by these transactions. The relationship between dimension tables and fact tables allows for meaningful analysis of business data, such as sales by product, revenue by region, or performance metrics by time period. This separation of descriptive data (dimension) and numeric data (fact) is a key principle in data warehousing and enables efficient data analysis and reporting.


Star Schema and Snowflake Schema are two common modeling techniques used in data warehousing and database design to structure data for efficient querying and reporting. Here are definitions and explanations of both schemas:

Star Schema:

A Star Schema is a type of data warehousing schema that organizes data into a central fact table and multiple dimension tables.
The central fact table contains quantitative data or measures, such as sales revenue, quantity, or profit, which can be aggregated.
Dimension tables store descriptive attributes that provide context for the measures. These attributes can include information about customers, products, time, and locations.
In a Star Schema, each dimension table is directly connected to the fact table through primary and foreign keys. This creates a simple and denormalized structure that is easy to understand and query.
Star Schemas are optimized for query performance and are ideal for business intelligence and reporting applications where the focus is on data retrieval and analysis.
Snowflake Schema:

A Snowflake Schema is a more normalized version of the Star Schema, where dimension tables are further divided into sub-dimensions or related attributes.
In a Snowflake Schema, dimension tables are often connected to additional dimension tables, forming a structured hierarchy of attributes. This hierarchy can create a branching pattern, resembling a snowflake.
The main advantage of the Snowflake Schema is reduced data redundancy and improved data integrity due to normalization.
However, Snowflake Schemas can be more complex to navigate and query compared to Star Schemas because of the additional joins required to access related attributes.
Snowflake Schemas are often used when data storage efficiency is a priority, but query performance may be sacrificed to some extent.


Dimension Tables:

CustomerDim - Information about hotel customers.
RoomDim - Information about hotel rooms.
ServiceDim - Information about hotel services.
DateDim - Information about dates, including year, month, day, etc.
Fact Table:

ReservationFact - Records reservations made by customers, including details about the customer, room, date, and services used during the stay.
Here's the SQL code to create these tables:


CREATE DATABASE Hotel_Management_System;
Hotel_Management_System;

-- Customer Dimension Table
CREATE TABLE CustomerDim (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Email VARCHAR(100),
    Phone VARCHAR(20),
    Address VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Room Dimension Table
CREATE TABLE RoomDim (
    RoomID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    RoomNumber INT,
    RoomType VARCHAR(50),
    MaxOccupancy INT,
    PricePerNight DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Service Dimension Table
CREATE TABLE ServiceDim (
    ServiceID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ServiceName VARCHAR(100),
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Date Dimension Table
CREATE TABLE DateDim (
    DateID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Date DATE,
    Year INT,
    Month VARCHAR(20),
    DayOfMonth INT,
    DayOfWeek VARCHAR(10)
);

-- Reservation Fact Table with Composite Primary Key
CREATE TABLE ReservationFact (
    ReservationID INT,
    CustomerID INT,
    RoomID INT,
    DateID INT,
    TotalNights INT,
    TotalCost DECIMAL(10, 2),
    PRIMARY KEY (ReservationID, CustomerID, RoomID, DateID),
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES CustomerDim(CustomerID),
    FOREIGN KEY (RoomID) REFERENCES RoomDim(RoomID),
    FOREIGN KEY (DateID) REFERENCES DateDim(DateID)
);
