Problem Statement:(Car Sales Analysis)

"A car dealership wants to analyze its sales performance and gain valuable insights into its business operations. The dealership has been collecting data on car sales over the past few years, including information about the cars sold, the dates of sales, and the locations of the buyers. The management wants to understand the factors that influence sales, identify top-performing car models and dealerships, and optimize their marketing and sales strategies.
Develop a star schema for car sales with dimensions: "Time," "Car," and "Location," connected to the fact table "CarSales." Time dimension includes day, month, year, and quarter; Car dimension includes make, model, year, and color; Location dimension includes country, city, state/province, and dealership names. Analyze data to determine top-selling car models per quarter, highest revenue dealerships in cities, sales performance by car color, overall sales trend over three years, and regional variations. Present insights through clear visualizations and reports. Success measured by accurate insights, efficient data retrieval, and quality of visualizations. Ensure flexibility for future data updates and changing business needs. Deliverables: star schema design, data analytics solution, and comprehensive report with insights and recommendations.
